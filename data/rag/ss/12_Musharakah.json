A debt fails to meet this requirement, as it is a receivable that is not available for use when the contract is concluded. Moreover, considering a debt as capital of Mudarabah involves potential Riba. This is because the creditor may be suspected of having extended the debt tenure in order to get additional consideration (for the extension) from the debtor under the name of Mudarabah.",
