It\nwas also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the\npredecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish\na Shari’ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting\ntreatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari’ah. However, considering the fact that there\nhad been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more\ncommon, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs. Accordingly,\nthe oard decided that there is a need to improve the existing FAS 8.",
